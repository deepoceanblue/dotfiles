! === Polish characters support: AltGr + char; AltGr is AltL key
! 5rd/6th col (lowercase/uppercase letters)
! de facto standard for inputting Polish chars 
! === additional special keys: Mode_switch + char; Mode_switch is Caps_lock key
! 3rd/4th col 
! workarounds for broken or oddly-placed keys on different keyboards.
! Whenever feasible these match readline C- combos, e.g.:
!     Ms-I for Tab (C-i in readline)
! with a notable exception of Ms-h being <Left> and not <BS>.
! Combos with Ms defined here:
!  - are respected by vast majority of apps (without readline, gui ones etc.)
!  - do not clash with apps' bindings, especially in gui
!  - work *good enough* with modifiers: C,S,A 
!    (X/term/console keyboard handling is full of minute inconsistencies; test extensively)

! ============ bindings
! hjkl are cursor keys:
!  - comfortable use of readline history
!  - for vim-like movement with no need to configure/patch/curse-out-loud individual apps
